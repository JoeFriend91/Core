# Welcome

blueCFD®-Core is an open source project provided by [blueCAPE Lda](http://www.bluecape.com.pt).

This project provides source code and high quality builds of OpenFOAM® technology
and related open source projects, as unofficial ports for up-to-date 64 bit Windows
7 to 10.

Additional tweaks, executables and scripts are also provided, in order to
maintain usability when working within Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.

The source code for the patched versions are tracked in the
[blueCFD project at Github](http://github.com/blueCFD).

This project is in continuous development, so keep track of how it's evolving at
the following locations:

 * [blueCAPE Lda Twitter](https://twitter.com/bluecapept)

**Note**: Contributions and collaboration with other companies are very much
welcome, but we're still working on the releases that we have planned. Please
follow our news feeds to know when we start accepting contributions.
