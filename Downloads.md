**Note:** This page is still a work in progress.

blueCFD®-Core is an open source project provided by [blueCAPE Lda](http://www.bluecape.com.pt).
It provides source code and high quality builds of OpenFOAM® technology and
related open source projects, as unofficial ports for up-to-date 64 bit Windows
7 to 10.

Additional tweaks, executables and scripts are also provided, in order to
maintain usability when working within Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.

Building for 32 bit and/or running on Windows XP should be possible
but it is not supported at the moment.
