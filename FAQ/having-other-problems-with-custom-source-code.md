title: Having other problems with custom source code
---

**Symptom**: If you try to build a custom solver or library, based on either
code from blueCFD-Core or OpenFOAM on Linux and it doesn't work within
blueCFD-Core's MSys2 shell environment.

**Solution**: Read the instructions given on the wiki:
[Loose notes on building custom code](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/wiki/Loose-notes-on-building-custom-code).
