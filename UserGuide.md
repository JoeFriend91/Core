# In Construction

This page is still a work in progress. We are aiming to bring in the old
documentation we have from blueCFD-Core 2.3-1, but the objective is to contribute
as much as possible to the [openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net) website,
so that everyone can contribute.

Table of content:
* [How to Install blueCFD-Core](#how-to-install-bluecfd-core)
* [Getting started with blueCFD-Core](#getting-started-with-bluecfd-core)
* [Instructions for source code developers](#instructions-for-source-code-developers)
* [Building community projects with blueCFD-Core](#building-community-projects-with-bluecfd-core)


# How to Install blueCFD-Core

A short video tutorial is available at [blueCFD-Core: Install How-To @ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl7er2t-TnU) for blueCFD-Core 2016-1 and is shown below as well:

**Notes**:

* The installation steps are very similar for blueCFD-Core 2017, therefore this video is still representative.

* If you already have 2016-1 installed, you can update by running the
installer for 2016-2 and use the same installation steps. The installer should
inherit the installation settings on its own.

    * The same will happen if you installed blueCFD-Core 2017-1 first and want to install 2017-2 later on.

check the instructions already [available on our wiki](https://github.com/blueCFD/Core/wiki/).


# Building community projects with blueCFD-Core

We are gradually adding ports of popular community projects to blueCFD-Core.
